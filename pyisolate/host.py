class ExtensionManager(Generic[T]):
    """Manager for loading and managing extensions in isolated environments.

    The ExtensionManager is the primary interface for working with pyisolate.
    It handles the creation of virtual environments, installation of dependencies,
    and lifecycle management of extensions. Each extension can run in its own
    isolated environment with specific dependencies, or share the host environment.

    Type Parameters:
        T: The base type of extensions this manager will handle. Must be a subclass
            of ExtensionBase.

    Attributes:
        config: The manager configuration containing settings like venv root path.
        extensions: Dictionary mapping extension names to their Extension instances.
        extension_type: The base extension class type for all managed extensions.

    Example:
        >>> import asyncio
        >>> from pyisolate import ExtensionManager, ExtensionManagerConfig, ExtensionConfig
        >>>
        >>> async def main():
        ...     # Create manager configuration
